# About Sourdough

Sourdough is the _starter_ (get it?) for data visualizations and stories at the
Michigan Daily. You can view the repository
[here](https://github.com/MichiganDaily/sourdough). You can view the full
documentation (in ArchieML) [here](). You can render the documentation by
following the instructions in the documentation (I heard you liked documentation
so this is documentation for documentation for documentation).
